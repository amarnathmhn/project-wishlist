# project-wishlist

These are activities of pure satisfaction and amazement I wish to do in my lifetime. Documenting these would be a reminder of what I enjoy doing no matter what phase of life I am in.

Here is my list of projects small and large, easy and difficult:

1)  Terrarium : A miniaturized self sustaining environment with insects, gravel, moss etc.

2)  Crystal Radio : A fascinating device that requires no batteries to receive AM signals using a simple tunable LC circuit.

3)  FPGA autonomous Robot : Just for fun. Manipulate dc/servo motors, trigger ultrasonic sensors, get feedback from encoders. Everything can be done in parallel and at great speed.

Real Value:

4)  Application to design front-end web pages without code. Just drag and drop.
5)  Idea tracker
6)  Project Manager
7)  Todo List with reminders and float around
